## Step-by-Step Commands and Explanations

### Step 1: Create the Initial Deployment

```bash
kubectl apply -f /root/deployment.yml
```

**Purpose:** Creates a Kubernetes deployment with 7 nginx pod replicas using the provided manifest file.

### Step 2: Create the HorizontalPodAutoscaler

```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment nginx-deployment --max=3 --cpu-percent=80
```

**Purpose:** Creates an HPA that will automatically scale the nginx-deployment between 1 and 3 replicas based on CPU utilization target of 80%.

**Alternative:** You could also use `kubectl apply -f /root/autoscale.yml`

### Step 3: Check HPA Status

```bash
kubectl get hpa
```

**Output:**

```bash
NAME               REFERENCE                     TARGETS              MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
nginx-deployment   Deployment/nginx-deployment   cpu: <unknown>/80%   1         3         3          4m20s
```

**Explanation:** The HPA shows `<unknown>/80%` for CPU targets, indicating it cannot retrieve current metrics.

### Step 4: Describe HPA for Detailed Information

```bash
kubectl describe hpa nginx-deployment
```

**Output:**

```bash

```

**Key Issue Identified:** Missing CPU resource requests in the container specification.

### Step 5: Update Deployment with Resource Requests

```bash
kubectl apply -f /root/deployment.yml
```

**Purpose:** Apply the updated deployment manifest that includes CPU resource requests, enabling HPA to function properly.

### Step 6: Monitor HPA Changes

```bash
kubectl get hpa --watch
```

**Output:**

```bash
NAME               REFERENCE                     TARGETS              MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS   AGE
nginx-deployment   Deployment/nginx-deployment   cpu: <unknown>/80%   1         3         3          7m39s
nginx-deployment   Deployment/nginx-deployment   cpu: <unknown>/80%   1         3         7          7m46s
nginx-deployment   Deployment/nginx-deployment   cpu: 0%/80%          1         3         3          8m1s
nginx-deployment   Deployment/nginx-deployment   cpu: 0%/80%          1         3         1          8m16s
```

**Explanation:** Shows the HPA transitioning from `<unknown>` to `0%` CPU utilization and automatically scaling down from 3 to 1 replica due to low CPU usage.

### Step 7: Check Scaling Events

```bash
kubectl events hpa nginx-deployment | grep -i "ScalingReplicaSet"
```

**Output:**

```bash
11m                      Normal    ScalingReplicaSet              Deployment/nginx-deployment                Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-647677fc66 from 0 to 7

104s                     Normal    ScalingReplicaSet              Deployment/nginx-deployment                Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-647677fc66 from 3 to 7
99s                      Normal    ScalingReplicaSet              Deployment/nginx-deployment                Scaled up replica set nginx-deployment-7998fdcbb8 from 3 to 4
99s                      Normal    ScalingReplicaSet              Deployment/nginx-deployment                Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-647677fc66 from 6 to 5
99s                      Normal    ScalingReplicaSet              Deployment/nginx-deployment                Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-647677fc66 from 5 to 4
76s (x9 over 99s)        Normal    ScalingReplicaSet              Deployment/nginx-deployment                (combined from similar events): Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-7998fdcbb8 from 3 to 1
```

### Step 8: Check Failed Resource Metric Events

```bash
kubectl events hpa nginx-deployment | grep -i "FailedGetResourceMetric"
```

**Output:**

```bash
8m35s (x3 over 9m50s)    Warning   FailedGetResourceMetric        HorizontalPodAutoscaler/nginx-deployment   failed to get cpu utilization: missing request for cpu in container nginx of Pod nginx-deployment-647677fc66-sb76d

## Key Concepts and Solutions

### What is HPA?

**Primary Purpose:** The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas in a deployment, replication controller, or replica set based on observed metrics such as CPU utilization or custom metrics provided by the metrics server.

### Metrics Server

**Component Responsible:** The metrics-server is a cluster-wide aggregator of resource usage data, and it provides the metrics required by the HPA to make scaling decisions.

### Problem Analysis

#### Root Cause of `<unknown>/80%` Status

The HPA status shows `<unknown>/80%` for the CPU target because:

1. **Missing Resource Requests:** The original deployment didn't specify CPU resource requests in the container specification
2. **HPA Dependency:** HPA requires resource requests to calculate CPU utilization percentages
3. **Metrics Server Issue:** Without resource requests, the metrics server cannot determine the baseline for CPU utilization calculations

#### Solution Approach

1. **Resource Requests:** Updated the deployment manifest to include CPU resource requests
2. **HPA Functionality:** This enables HPA to calculate CPU utilization as a percentage of requested resources
3. **Automatic Scaling:** Once metrics are available, HPA can make informed scaling decisions

### Event Analysis

#### ScalingReplicaSet Events

**Meaning:** These events indicate that the deployment controller is scaling replica sets up or down based on:

- Initial deployment creation (0 â†’ 7 replicas)
- HPA constraints (7 â†’ 3 replicas due to maxReplicas limit)
- Rolling updates (creating new replica sets with updated resource specifications)
- CPU-based scaling decisions (scaling down to 1 replica due to low CPU usage)

#### FailedGetResourceMetric Events

**Cause:** The HPA cannot retrieve CPU utilization metrics because the nginx container doesn't have CPU resource requests defined, which are required for calculating CPU utilization percentages.

## Summary

This exercise demonstrates the complete lifecycle of deploying and troubleshooting a Kubernetes HPA:

1. **Initial Setup:** Deploy nginx with 7 replicas
2. **HPA Creation:** Set up autoscaling with max 3 replicas and 80% CPU target
3. **Problem Identification:** HPA cannot get metrics due to missing resource requests
4. **Root Cause Analysis:** Use `kubectl describe` to identify the specific issue
5. **Solution Implementation:** Update deployment with proper resource specifications
6. **Validation:** Monitor HPA behavior and scaling events

The key learning point is that HPA requires resource requests to function properly, as it calculates utilization as a percentage of requested resources rather than absolute values.
